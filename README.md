# Pdf-Rag-System
A flexible Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system deployed as a Streamlit web application. This interface allows users to dynamically configure their pipeline by choosing between GPT-4 or Llama3.2 as the LLM, and OpenAI, Nomic, or Chroma Default as the embedding model. It leverages ChromaDB for persistent vector storage, ingesting and chunking uploaded PDF documents. The interactive chat provides a powerful way to query the documents, with the system intelligently retrieving relevant context to generate grounded and accurate responses from the selected LLM while providing the source passage.
